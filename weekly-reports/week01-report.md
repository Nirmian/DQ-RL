## Type of game

We intend to implement a roguelike PvE co-op 2d platformer.

The Heroes' objective is to slay bad man and complete their missions in a medieval fantasy setting. The players explore the world toghether and use their combined abilities to surpass enemies and reach the level's end. Being a co-op, the players have to pay attention to compatibility and cumulative equipment attributes to be able to cope with each situation. 

The players can choose one of the following classes: knight, mage, dragon, rogue each with their unique abilities which can interact togheter in various ways. There are 3 types of enemies: undead, orcs and demons and specific equipment has to be used to vanquish each and every one of them.
